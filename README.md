# React Fit

A fitness dashboard app showing stats based on your Fitbit data

To use the app, you'll need a [Fitbit](https://fitbit.com) account.

Sign up and then go to the [Fitbit Developers website](https://dev.fitbit.com) and create a new app.

Get the Client ID from your app settings and set it in `Dashboard.jsx`:

``` const CLIENT_ID = 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID'

Run the app by starting the Rails server and Webpack dev server

```
$ rails s -p 8000

$ ./bin/webpack-dev-server

```
