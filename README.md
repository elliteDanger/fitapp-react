# React Fit

A fitness dashboard app showing stats based on your Fitbit data.

Learn [how to build this fitness dashboard app using Rails 5.1 and React](https://learnetto.com/users/hrishio/courses/the-complete-react-on-rails-5-course) with a step-by-step hands-on tutorial on [Learnetto](https://learnetto.com).

To use the app, you'll need a [Fitbit](https://fitbit.com) account.

Sign up and then go to the [Fitbit Developers website](https://dev.fitbit.com) and create a new app.

Get the Client ID from your app settings and set it in `Dashboard.jsx`:

``` const CLIENT_ID = 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID'

Run the app by starting the Rails server and Webpack dev server

```
$ rails s -p 8000

$ ./bin/webpack-dev-server

```
